The goal of the project is to compare speed and user friendliness. We have build-in some basic image filters and you are able to write your own OpenCL or Renderscript code in the text view. It's possible to build the code in the text view at run time. This way it's easy to test your own code. The written code and the output images are very easy to save with our application so the user can easily re-use his own code.\r\n\r\nTo help the users getting started, we also have a template you can use and it's also possible to read/edit the build-in image filters. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with the project? Feel free to contact us at driesgoossens93@gmail.com .","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
